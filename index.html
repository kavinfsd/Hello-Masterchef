      <li>
        Start with frying cashews and raisins in ghee separately and take them out and keep aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next in the same pan add rava and roast it while stirring continuously. You want the rava 
        to become light golden, but we don't want the rava to become brown or burn. The rava turns 
        light and aromatic.

        Roasting the rava will take around 8-10 minutes and it is the most important step. 
        need to roast the rava well but not it be in raw. Then transfer the rava into a separate 
        plate and let it to be cool.

        Take a bowl add roasted rava, sugar, cardamom powder, boiled milk and roasted cashews and 
        raisines along with the ghee then mix them with a spoon until it is all combined perfectly.
      </li>

        Now bind the mixture with hand into a laddu shape, If you not able to make the shape then 
        add one table spoon milk and try again.
